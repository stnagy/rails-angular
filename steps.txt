    gem 'byebug'

    # Access an IRB console on exception pages or by using <%= console %> in views
    gem 'web-console', '~> 2.0'

    # Spring speeds up development by keeping your application running in the background. Read more: https://github.com/rails/spring
    gem 'spring'

    gem 'rspec-rails'
    gem 'factory_girl_rails'
    gem 'capybara'
    gem 'database_cleaner'
    gem 'selenium-webdriver'
  end

  npm install -g bower
  gem 'bower-rails'
